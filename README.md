# Cryptographically-Secure-Pseudorandom-Number-generators

In this repository you will find the simulated random bit sequences of the generators: AES, Alternating Step Generator, Blum-Blum-Shub, /dev/random, Fortuna, Self-Shrinkage, Shrinkage, Sober-128, Trifork and Yarrow. You will also find the results of the NIST test battery.

In the "Results" folder you will find the results of the NIST test battery of the generators, and you can find the data used in the data release.
